# Quantum Multiplier

This is a function that performs multiplication on quantum computers using QFT. We use multiple controlled QFTAdditions to perform QFT based addition. A primary benefit of performing multiplication on quantum computers using QFT is the reduced number of qubits. This will be written in Python 3 and use Google's Cirq.
